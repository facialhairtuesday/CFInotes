The learner can explain different aeromedical factors, and their importance to flying and possible effects during flight.

## Hypoxia
Hypoxia, which means "reduced oxygen" or "not enough oxygen", is of the greatest concern with oxygen deprivation to the brain, which is particularly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation.
### Forms of Hypoxia
#### Hypoxic Hypoxia
Result of insufficient oxygen available to the body as a whole
- A blocked airway or drowning are examples of how the lungs and body as a whole can be deprived of oxygen

For pilots, the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude is a common example

>[!Info] Partial Pressure
>The amount of pressure that a single gas out of a mixture contributes to the total pressure

Although the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is constant with changes in altitude, partial pressure decreases as altitude increases
- As you ascend, the percentage of each gas remains the same, but the molecules no longer have the pressure required to drive oxygen into the respiratory system
- The decrease of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressure leads to hypoxic hypoxia
### Hypemic Hypoxia
When the blood is not able to take up and transport sufficient oxygen to the cells in the body
