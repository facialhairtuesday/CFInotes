![[Airspace Summary Chart.png]]
![[Basic VFR Weather Minimums Chart.png]]
### Special VFR
Clearance to operate under VFR with less than VFR weather minimums
* Only in Class B, C, D, or E surface areas below 10,000' MSL
* Must be request by the pilot
* On the basis of weather conditions at the airport of intended landing/departure
* Only approved if IFR traffic not delayed

SVFR may only be conducted:
- With an ATC clearance
- Clear of clouds
- With at least 1sm flight visibility
- At night (sunset to sunrise), pilot must be instrument rated and aircraft instrument equipped

May not takeoff or land under SVFR unless ground visibility is at least 1sm
	If not reported, flight visibility must be at least 1sm

SVFR is prohibited at certain airports as shown in [Part 91 Appendix D Section 3](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91#Appendix-D-to-Part-91)
	Mostly large class B airports

### Special Use Airspace
Airspace where activities must be confined because of their nature. Limitations may be placed on aircraft not part of the activities

#### Types of SUA:
* [[#Prohibited Areas]]
* [[#Restricted Areas]]
* [[#Warning Areas]]
* [[#Military Operation Areas]]
* [[#Alert Areas]]
* [[#Controlled Firing Areas]]

###### Prohibited Areas
Airspace within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited
- Established for security or other reasons associated with the national welfare
- Published in the Federal Register and depicted on aeronautical charts
###### Restricted Areas
Areas where operations are hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. Contains airspace within which the flight of aircraft is subject to restrictions
- Can contain unusual, often invisible hazards
	- Artillery firing
	- Aerial gunnery
	- Guided missiles
	- Etc.
- Penetration without authorization can be extremely hazardous
	- Can check with controlling agency to see if area is "hot"
- IFR aircraft may be authorized to transit and routed accordingly
- Published in the Federal Register and depicted on aeronautical charts
###### Warning Areas
Airspace extending from 3nm outward from the coast containing activity that may be hazardous to non participating aircraft
	Similar to Restricted Area
- Purpose is to warn nonparticipating pilots of the potential danger
- Depicted on aeronautical charts
###### Military Operation Areas (MOA)
Airspace with defined vertical and lateral limits established for separating certain military training activity from IFR traffic
	IFR traffic may be cleared through an MOA if ATC can guarantee separation
- Depicted on aeronautical charts

There is no restriction against a pilot operating VFR in these areas
	A pilot should be alert as training activities can include aerobatic and abrupt maneuvers

###### Alert Areas
Used to advise pilots that a high volume of pilot training or unusual aerial activity is taking place
- Depicted on aeronautical charts
###### Controlled Firing Areas
Contain activities that could be hazardous to aircraft
- Activities are suspended when an aircraft might be approaching the area
- Not charted since they do not cause a nonparticipating aircraft to need to change route of flight

### Other Airspace Areas
[[#Special Flight Rules Area]]
[[#Local Airport Advisory]]
[[#Military Training Routes]]
[[#Temporary Flight Restrictions]]
[[#Parachute Jump Areas]]
[[#Published VFR Routes]]
[[#Terminal Radar Service Areas]]
[[#National Security Areas]]

###### Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA)
Special airspace governed by [Part 93](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-93)
	Normal rules do not necessarily apply

Depicted on VFR charts and Terminal Area Charts

Washington DC ([Part 93 Subpart V](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-93#subpart-V)) is best known example.
	Created after 9/11. Must file SFRA flight plan, obtain discrete transponder code, be in contact with ATC, and accomplish specific training
###### Local Airport Advisory
Area within 10sm of an airport without a control tower but where an FSS is on the airport
	FSS provides a complete local advisory service to arriving and departing aircraft
###### Military Training Routes
Routes used by military aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying
	Generally below 10,000' MSL for operation at speeds in excess of 250kts

Routes are identified on charts as IFR (IR) or VFR (VR), followed by a number
	MTR with no segment above 1,500' AGL identified by 4-digit number
		Ex: IR1206, VR1207
	MTR with one or more segments above 1,500' AGL identified by 3-digit number
		Ex: VR407
###### Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR)
Temporary restriction issued for one of the following reasons:
- Protect people or property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard
- Provide a safe environment for disaster relief aircraft
- Prevent unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an event, incident, or location
- Protect POTUS, VPOTUS, and/or other VIPs
- Provide a safe environment for space operations

An FDC NOTAM will be issued to designate a TFR ([FAA TFR List](https://tfr.faa.gov/))

###### Parachute Jump Areas\
Areas with regular parachute jumping activity
- Published in the Chart Supplement
- Frequently used sites are depicted on Sectional Charts
###### Published VFR Routes
Used for transitioning around, under, or through some complex airspace
	Also called:
	- VFR Flyway
	- VFR Corridor
	- VFR Transition Route
	- Terminal Area VFR Route

Generally found on VFR Terminal Area Charts
###### Terminal Radar Service Areas
Areas where participating pilots can receive additional radar services
	_Service is optional, not required_

Provides separation between all IFR and participating VFR traffic

The primary airport(s) within a TRSA becomes [[#Class D Airspace]]. The remaining area of the TRSA overlies other controlled airspace, which is normally [[#Class E Airspace]]

Depicted on VFR Sectional Charts
###### National Security Areas
Areas with a requirement for increased security and safety of ground facilities

Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through these areas, but when necessary flight may be temporarily prohibited

### VFR Charts
[[Aeronautical Chart Users Guide.pdf#page=17|Aeronautical Chart Users Guide]]

[[II.I. Navigation & Flight Planning]] section has more info regarding charts

- Terminal Area and Sectional Charts are updated every 56 days
- Wall Planning Charts are updated annually

Information on charts can change rapidly, it is essential to check the effective dates of the charts/publications being used and to ensure to only use current and up-to-date charts
	To confirm currency, refer to the next scheduled edition date published on the cover or check on the [FAA's Dates of Latest Editions](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/productcatalog/doles/)
