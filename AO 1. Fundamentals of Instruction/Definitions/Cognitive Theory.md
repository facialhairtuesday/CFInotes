Cognitive Theory focuses on what is going on in the mind. Learning isn't just a behavior change, it is a change in the way a learner thinks, understands, and feels. Cognitive Theory has 2 major branches:
1. [[#Information Processing Theory]]
2. [[#Constructivism]]
###### [[Information Processing Theory]]:
Information Processing Theory uses the concept of a computer system to model the actions of the brain. The brain processes incoming information, stores and retrieves it, and generates responses to the information. This involves a number of cognitive processes:
* Gathering and representing information (encoding)
* Retaining of information
* Retrieving the information when needed
###### [[Constructivism]]:
Constructivism is the concept that learners do not acquire knowledge and skills passively but *actively build or construct them based on their experiences*. In this theory, learning is the result of matching new information against preexisting information and integrating it into meaningful connections.

Constructivism also encompasses Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) from Bloom's Taxonomy and [[Scenario Based Training]], also referred to as Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) ^aa810b
* An important common thread in aviation accidents is the absence of HOTS

Teaching HOTS effectively helps engage the learner in mental activity, has the learner examine that mental activity and select the best solution, and challenges the learner to explore other ways to accomplish the task.  HOTS should be taught like other cognitive skills, from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract.  This involves: ^466fff
* Problem-based instruction
* Authentic / real world problems
* Active learning / Cooperative learning
* Customized instruction to meet the individual learner's needs
