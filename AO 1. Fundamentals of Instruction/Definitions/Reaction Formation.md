Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in psychology where someone unconsciously replaces an unwanted impulse with its opposite, often in an exaggerated way. This can cause people to express themselves in ways that are different from their authentic selves.
- Protect from dangerous desires by developing opposite attitudes / behaviors

<u>Examples</u>:
- Someone might insult someone they are romantically interested in, or be kind to someone they dislike. 
- A boy who bullies a girl because he is subconsciously attracted to her.
