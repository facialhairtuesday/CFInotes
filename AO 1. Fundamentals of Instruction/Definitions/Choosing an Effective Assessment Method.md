When deciding how to assess learner progress, instructors can follow a 4-step process:
1. [[#Determine Level-of-Learning Objectives]]
2. [[#List Indicators of Desired Behaviors]]
3. [[#Establish Criterion Objectives]]
4. [[#Develop Criterion-Referenced Test Items]]

This process is useful for tests that apply to the cognitive and affective domains of learning, and can also be used for skill testing in the psychomotor domain.

## Determine Level-of-Learning Objectives
State the individual objectives as general, level of learning objectives.

The objectives should measure one of the learning levels of the cognitive, affective, or psychomotor domains

A general level-of-learning objective is a good starting point for developing a test because it defines the scope of the learning task
## List Indicators of Desired Behaviors
List the indicators or samples of behavior that give the best indication of the achievement of the objective.
	The instructor selects behaviors that can be measured and which give the best evidence of learning.

The overall test must be comprehensive enough to give a true representation of the learning to be measured by choosing samples of behavior.
## Establish Criterion Objectives
Define criterion (performance-based) objectives. In addition to the behavior expected, state the conditions under which the behavior is to be performed and the criteria that must be met
## Develop Criterion-Referenced Test Items
Written test questions should attempt to measure the behavior described in the criterion objectives
	Questions missed identify areas not adequately addressed

Performance testing for maneuvers is desirable for evaluating training based on ACS/PTS standards.  It is the instructors job to prepare the learner for the practical test, so it is critical to evaluate the learner on all tasks before recommending them for a practical test.
