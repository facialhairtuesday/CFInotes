Compensation is focusing on achievement in one area of life in order to distract attention away from the inadequacy or fear of inadequacy in another area of life.
- May develop a less preferred / more attainable goal instead of one more preferred / less attainable

<u>Example</u>:
- If you know you have poor public speaking skills, you might try to compensate for those weaknesses by excelling in your written communications at work.
