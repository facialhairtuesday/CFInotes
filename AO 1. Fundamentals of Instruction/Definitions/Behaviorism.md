Behaviorism explains behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli. In other words, human behavior can be predicted based on past rewards and punishments. In modern behaviorism, positive reinforcement is stressed, to encourage progress and learning with rewards.  The popularity of behaviorism as a learning theory has waned as more is understood about the complexity of the learning process.
