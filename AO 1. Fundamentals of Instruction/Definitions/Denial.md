Denial is a defense mechanism in which an individual refuses to recognize or acknowledge objective facts or experiences. It's an unconscious process that serves to protect the person from discomfort or anxiety.
- Refusal to accept a reality because it is too threatening

<u>Example</u>:
- Someone denies that they have an alcohol or substance use disorder because they can still function and go to work each day.
