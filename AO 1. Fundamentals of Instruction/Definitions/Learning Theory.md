Learning theory is a body of principles used to explain how people acquire skills, knowledge, and attitudes.  It is typically explained by one of two concepts:
1. [[#Behaviorism]]
2. [[#Cognitive Theory]]

Instructors should plan, manage, and conduct aviation training with the best features of both theories. This provides a way to measure the behavioral outcomes and promote cognitive learning.

###### [[Behaviorism]]:
Behaviorism explains behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli. In other words, human behavior can be predicted based on past rewards and punishments. In modern behaviorism, positive reinforcement is stressed, to encourage progress and learning with rewards.  The popularity of behaviorism as a learning theory has waned as more is understood about the complexity of the learning process.

###### [[Cognitive Theory]]:
Cognitive Theory focuses on what is going on in the mind. Learning isn't just a behavior change, it is a change in the way a learner thinks, understands, and feels. Cognitive Theory has 2 major branches:
1. [[#Information Processing Theory]]
2. [[#Constructivism]]
###### [[Information Processing Theory]]:
Information Processing Theory uses the concept of a computer system to model the actions of the brain. The brain processes incoming information, stores and retrieves it, and generates responses to the information. This involves a number of cognitive processes:
* Gathering and representing information (encoding)
* Retaining of information
* Retrieving the information when needed
###### [[Constructivism]]:
Constructivism is the concept that learners do not acquire knowledge and skills passively but *actively build or construct them based on their experiences*. In this theory, learning is the result of matching new information against preexisting information and integrating it into meaningful connections.

Constructivism also encompasses Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) from Bloom's Taxonomy and [[#Scenario Based Training]], also referred to as Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) ^aa810b
* An important common thread in aviation accidents is the absence of HOTS

Teaching HOTS effectively helps engage the learner in mental activity, has the learner examine that mental activity and select the best solution, and challenges the learner to explore other ways to accomplish the task.  HOTS should be taught like other cognitive skills, from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract.  This involves: ^466fff
* Problem-based instruction
* Authentic / real world problems
* Active learning / Cooperative learning
* Customized instruction to meet the individual learner's needs
###### [[Scenario Based Training]]
Scenario Based Training (SBT) is the heart of HOTS and ADM, and an example of Problem Based Learning (PBL). It uses real world scenarios to address flight training objectives, and should generally be planned and led by the learner.
