### [[PAVE Checklist]]
The PAVE checklist allows the pilot to divide the risks of flight into four categories:

#### P = Pilot in command
The pilot is one of the risk factors in a flight. When considering that risk, the pilot considers if they are ready for this trip, in terms of experience, currency, and physical and emotional condition.

The [[IMSAFE Checklist]] combined with proficiency, recency, and currency helps provide the answer

#### A = Aircraft
What limitations will the aircraft impost on the trip?
- Is this the right aircraft for the flight?
- Am I familiar with and current in this aircraft?
- Is the aircraft equipped appropriately for this flight?
	- Instruments
	- Lights
	- Navigation/Communication Equipment
- Can this aircraft safely use the runways available for this trip?
- Can this aircraft carry the planned load
- Can this aircraft operate at the altitudes needed for this trip
- Does this aircraft have sufficient fuel capacity with reserves for the trip legs?
- Does the fuel quantity delivered match the fuel quantity ordered?

#### enVironment
##### Weather
- What are the current and forecast ceiling and visibility?
- What if the weather is different than the forecast
	- What are the alternate/divert options and plans?
- What are the winds, especially crosswinds?
- Turbulence, especially in mountainous terrain?
- Thunderstorms present or forecast?
- If there are clouds, is there any icing currently or forecast?
- Temp/dewpoint spread for decent?
##### Terrain and Obstacles
- Minimum safe altitudes enroute
- Any nearby terrain or obstacles that dictate route choices
##### Airports
- Available airport lighting? Pilot controlled?
	- For night ops
	- VASI/PAPI
- NOTAMs for closed airports or runways
- Route of flight to have alternates
- Shorter or obstructed fields at the destination/alternate?
##### Airspace
- Appropriate clothing/water/survival gear onboard if traveling over remote areas
- If traveling over water or unpopulated areas at night, will there be a loss of visual references?
- Controlled airspace/TFRs/etc along route of flight
##### Night Flying
- Flight over water or unpopulated areas
- Will the flight conditions allow a safe emergency landing at night?
- Are the aircraft lights operational during preflight?
- Is a flashlight available that is appropriate for use?
#### External pressures
Influences external to the flight that create a sense of pressure to complete the flight, often at the expense of safety
- Someone waiting at the airport for the flight's arrival
- A passenger the pilot doesn't want to disappoint
- The desire to demonstrate qualifications as a pilot
- The desire to impress someone
- "Get-there-itis"

Management of external pressures is the single most important key to risk management because it is the one risk factor category that can cause a pilot to ignore all the other risk factors

The use of Standard Operating Procedures is one way to manage external pressures.  Be ready for and accept delays, have alternate options available, etc.

### [[5P Checklist]]
Used to evaluate the situation at key decision points during the flight or when an emergency arises
- Very helpful part of Single Pilot Resource Management (SRM)
- Based on the idea that the pilot has five variables that impact the environment and lead to a decision
- At least 5 times before and during the flight, review and consider the 5P's and make the appropriate decision required by the current situation
	- Decision Points:
		- Preflight
		- Pre-takeoff
		- Hourly or at the midpoint of flight
		- Pre-descent
		- Just prior to FAF or entering the pattern

5P's:
1. Plan
	- The mission. Contains:
		- Planning
		- Weather
		- Route
		- Fuel
		- Pubs Currency
		- Etc.
	- Always changing, adjust with it
2. Plane
	- Conditions
	- Abilities
		- Performance
		- Automation
		- Database currency
		- Etc.
	- Equipment
	- Systems
	- Etc.
3. Pilot
	- [[IMSAFE Checklist]]
		- Recognize and review your physiological situation
4. Passengers
	- A passenger's desires can influence decision making and risk management
	- Ensure passengers are involved in the decision making process and that they understand risk involved in situations.
	- Understand what the passengers want to do
5. Programming
	- Plan in advance when and where programming approaches/route changes, and airport information gathering should and should not be accomplished
	- Familiarity with the equipment, route, local ATC environment, and personal capabilities should drive this

### [[Flight Risk Assessment Tools]]
Enables proactive hazard identification, is easy to use, and visually depicts risk

Formal process using a pen and paper to help remove personal desires and emotion from decision making
- Determine an acceptable [[Level of Risk]] for flight based on type of operation, environment, aircraft, etc.
	- Create realistic numerical thresholds that trigger additional levels of scrutiny
	- When risk exceeds the acceptable level, reevaluate and reduce risk, or don't fly
