Aeronautical decision-making (ADM) is decision-making in a unique environmentâ€”aviation. It is a systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances. It is what a pilot intends to do based on the latest information he or she has.
