Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which people justify difficult or unacceptable feelings with seemingly logical reasons and explanations
- When true rationalization takes place, individuals sincerely believe in their excuses

<u>Example</u>:
- A student who is rejected from her dream college may explain that she's happy to be attending a school that's less competitive and more welcoming
