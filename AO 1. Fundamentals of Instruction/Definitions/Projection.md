Projection is a form of defense in which unwanted feelings are displaced onto another person, where they then appear as a threat from the external world.
- Blame is relegated to others for their own shortcomings, mistakes, and transgressions

<u>Example</u>:
- An individual, threatened by his own angry feelings, accuses another of harbouring hostile thoughts
