Subconsciously blocking ideas or impulses that are undesirable. This defense mechanism may be present in someone who has no recollection of a traumatic event, even though they were conscious and aware during the event.
- Uncomfortable thoughts are placed in inaccessible areas of the unconscious mind

<u>Example</u>:
- A child is bitten by a dog. They later develop a severe phobia of dogs but have no memory of when or how this fear originated.
