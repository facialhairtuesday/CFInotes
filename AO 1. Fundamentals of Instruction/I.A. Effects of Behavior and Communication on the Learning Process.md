## Elements of Human Behavior

### Human Behavior
The study of Human Behavior is an attempt to explain how and why humans function the way they do.
#### Multiple theories and definitions:
* ##### Scientific World:
	Product of factors that cause people to act predictably
* ##### Satisfying Needs:
	Behavior is result of attempts to satisfy needs
* ##### Life Course of Humans:
	As humans grow, behaviors change

Personality type classifications try to explain that seeming random variation in human behavior is quite structured due to differences in way individuals prefer to use their perception & judgment
	Ex: Myers Briggs Type Indicator

Instructor must understand their style of teaching and as much as possible adapt to learners

The instructor’s challenge is to know what controls are best for existing circumstances
	Create an atmosphere that enables / encourages learners to help themselves toward their goals
	It is the instructor’s responsibility to discover how to realize the potential in each learner

>[!Summary] Human Behavior
>**A working knowledge of behavior can help an instructor better understand a learner**

### Motivations:
Motivations are the reason one acts or behaves in a certain way and lies at the heart of goals.
	Probably the dominant force governing progress and ability to learn
#### Positive Motivations
- Typically the most successful method
	- Promise or achievement of awards (personal, social, financial, satisfaction of self, recognition)
		- Secure, pleasant conditions, a safe environment
		- Tangible return for efforts
		- Group approval/belonging
		- Favorable self-image
#### Maintaining Motivation
Maintaining motivation can be difficult in the long term. Common methods that an instructor can use to help maintain the motivation of their students include:
###### Rewarding Success
Praise incremental successes and relate accomplishments to lesson objectives
###### Present New Challenges
Drops in Motivation are natural, especially after the initial excitement wears off. It is important to remind learners of their goals and reasons for training and that plateaus are normal

### Human Needs
Human Needs can be organized into levels of importance. 
	This is typically referred to as the Hierarchy of Human Needs
		Until the needs are satisfied, one can’t focus fully on learning, self-expression, or any other task
	Once a need is satisfied, it no longer provides motivation

#### Hierarchy of Human Needs:
1. <u>Physiological</u>
	 Biological needs
		 Food, rest, and protection from the elements
2. <u>Security</u>
	 Protection against danger, threats, deprivation affect learner behavior
3. <u>Belonging</u>
	 Belong, to associate, and to give and receive friendship and love
4. <u>Esteem</u>
	Internal
		Relating to self-esteem: confidence, independence, achievement, competence, knowledge
	External
		Relating to reputation: status, recognition, appreciation, and respect of associates
5. <u>Cognitive and Aesthetic</u>
	Cognitive: Need to know and understand
		If a person understands, they can control the situation and make informed decisions
	Aesthetic: Emotional needs
		If an instructor does not like a learner, this feeling may affect the instructor’s ability to teach
6. <u>Self-Actualization</u>
	When all other needs are satisfied, only then can self-actualization be attained
	Realizing one’s own potential for continued development and reaching personal goals and potential

>[!Summary] Human Needs
>**Help learners satisfy their own needs in a manner that will create a healthy learning environment**

### Defense Mechanisms
Subconscious, almost automatic, ego-protecting reactions to unpleasant situations
	Used to soften feelings of failure, to alleviate feelings of guilt, and to protect personal worth

There are 8 typical defense mechanisms:
>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Denial]]:
> Refusal to accept a reality because it is too threatening

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Repression]]:
>Uncomfortable thoughts are placed in inaccessible areas of the unconscious mind

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Displacement]]:
> Unconscious shift in emotion from the original object to a less threatening substitute

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Rationalization]]:
> Subconscious technique for justifying actions that otherwise would be unacceptable
> - When true rationalization takes place, individuals sincerely believe in their excuses. 

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Fantasy]]:
> Daydreaming about how things should be rather than doing something about how they are

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Compensation]]:
> Disguising the presence of a weak quality by emphasizing a more positive one
>- May develop a less preferred / more attainable goal instead of one more preferred / less attainable

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Projection]]:
>Blame is relegated to others for their own shortcomings, mistakes, and transgressions

>[!defense-mechanisms] [[Reaction Formation]]:
>Protect from dangerous desires by developing opposite attitudes / behaviors

## Learner Emotional Reactions
Typical emotional reactions from learners are important to understand and recognize in the student.
#### Anxiety – “A state of mental uneasiness arising from fear…”
- Most significant psychological factor affecting flight instruction
	- Anxiety can be countered by reinforcing enjoyment of flying, and by teaching to cope with fear
#### Impatience
- Seeks only the ultimate objective without considering the means to reach it
	- Present training one step at a time, with clear goals for each step. Tailor instruction to learner‘s pace
#### Worry or Lack of Interest
- Those worried or emotionally upset are not ready to learn and derive little benefit from instruction
	- Divert attention from their worries and troubles to the tasks at hand
	- Ensure the learner knows exactly how well they have progressed and what deficiencies are present
#### Physical Discomfort, Illness, Fatigue, and Dehydration
- Slow the rate of learning, and should be mitigated to the extent possible
##### Fatigue
One of the most dangerous hazards to flight safety. Impairs judgement / decision making
###### Acute Fatigue:
Normal occurrence of everyday living
###### Chronic Fatigue:
Combination of physiological / psychological problems (financial, home, etc.)

![[Warning Signs of Fatigue.png]]

![[Countermeasures to Fatigue.png]]

##### Dehydration and Heatstroke
###### Dehydration:
Critical loss of water to the body. Reduces alertness
###### Heatstroke
Inability of the body to control its temperature
- Carry ample water on any long flight, keep the temperature cool, and wear light clothing

#### Apathy Due to Inadequate Instruction
- Provide well-planned, appropriate, and accurate instruction
- Instruction should be meaningful. Teach to the level of the learner
- Once the instructor loses confidence, it is difficult to regain, and learning is diminished

#### Stress
Stress is a natural human response to a difficult situation that causes mental tension or worry.  It is usually triggered when someone feels threatened or under pressure, and they don't feel they can control the situation.

##### Normal Reactions to Stress
People respond rapidly and exactly, within the limits of their experience and training
- This is desired, stress should not overwhelm and cause abnormal reactions (below)
##### Abnormal Reactions to Stress
Response may be random, illogical, completely absent, or at least inadequate
- Over-cooperation, extreme self-control, inappropriate laughter or singing, rapid emotion changes
##### Flight Instructors Actions Regarding Seriously Abnormal Learners
- Refrain from instructing the learner and assure they don’t continue training or become certificated
- Arrange for another instructor to conduct an evaluation flight. After the flight, the instructors should confer to determine whether they agree that further investigation or action is justified

## Teaching the Adult Learner
Flight students tend to be older (~30+)
* Learning is a means to an end (generally have a use for the knowledge/skill)
* Seek out learning experiences to cope with specific life changing events (marriage, new job, etc.)
* Autonomous & self-directed; need to be independent & exercise control
* Draw from foundation of life experience and knowledge for learning
* Goal & relevancy oriented
* Practical, focusing on aspects of a lesson most useful to them in their work
* Need to be shown respect
* Need to increase or maintain a sense of self-esteem is a strong secondary motivator
* Want to solve problems & apply new knowledge immediately

>[!Important] To effectively teach the adult learner:
>* Clarify and articulate learner expectations early
>* Provide an organized training syllabus with clearly defined objectives
>* Recognize the learner’s need to control pace and start/stop time
>* Use scenario-based training (takes advantage of preference to self-direct)
>* Help learners integrate new ideas with what they already know
>* Provide self-directed learning involving other people as resources, guides, etc. (don’t isolate)
>* Use books, programmed instruction and computers which are popular with adults
>* Refrain from “spoon-feeding”
>* Set a cooperative learning climate
>* Create opportunities for mutual planning

## Effective Communication
Communication doesn’t occur automatically, and a communication style must be developed that can convey info to learners.

>[!Important] Communication
>Communication takes place when a person transmits ideas / feelings to another. The effectiveness of communication is measured by the similarity between the idea transmitted and the idea received
>
>**A change in behavior is the goal of communication**
#### There are 3 elements of communication
##### The Source → The Instructor
Effectiveness as a communicator is related to 3 basic factors:
	Ability to select/use language is essential for transmitting information
	Communicators reveal information about themselves
	Material is accurate, up-to-date, and stimulating
##### The Symbols → Words or symbols used to transmit info
Determine the symbols best to start / end and those best for explaining, clarifying, emphasizing
	Determine which medium is best suited for transmission (hearing, seeing, touch)
Monitor the feedback from a learner as symbols may need to be modified for clarity
Learners need feedback on how they are doing
	Negative feedback in private only
##### The Receiver → The Learner

With effective communication, the receivers react with understanding and change their behavior accordingly. **It is critical to remember that not all learners learn in the same way, and using multiple approaches is most effective**

## Risk Management: Barriers to Effective Communication
##### Lack of Common Experience:
The greatest single barrier to effective communication. It is is essential that instructors speak the same language as the learners. When specific terminology is needed, ensure understanding, don't just assume understanding.
##### Confusion Between the Symbol and the Symbolized Object:
This occurs when the meaning or intent of words and/or the context isn’t clear (ex. Sarcasm)
##### Overuse of Abstractions:
Abstractions are words that are general rather than specific, and they may not evoke the same items of experience in the learner’s minds
##### External Factors:
Factors outside the instructor’s control that prevent an activity from being carried out properly. There are multiple types of external factors.
- Physiological interference - physical problem inhibiting understanding (injury, hearing loss, etc.)
- Environmental interference - caused by external physical conditions (like noise)
- Psychological interference - product of how the learner / instructor feel
##### Interference:
This occurs when the message gets disrupted or truncated. Ensure the learner understands the message

## Developing Communication Skills
Because communication is a skill, it must be practiced and developed. There are multiple ways of developing communication skills:
##### Role Playing
Practice instructing to develop communication skills, techniques, etc.
##### Instructional Communication
Know the topic well; Do not be afraid to use examples of past experience to illustrate points
	Determine the level of understanding by some sort of evaluation
##### Listening
Listen to understand rather than refute
##### Questioning
Good questioning can determine how well a learner understands
Ask open ended and focused questions
Paraphrasing and perception checking can confirm understanding
##### Instructional Enhancement
The deeper the knowledge about an area, the better the instructor is at conveying it

## Risk Management: Recognizing & Accommodating Human Behavior

* Working knowledge of Human Behavior can help an instructor better understand a learner, which leads to successful instruction
* Understand and adjust for different personalities, motivators, learning styles, etc.
