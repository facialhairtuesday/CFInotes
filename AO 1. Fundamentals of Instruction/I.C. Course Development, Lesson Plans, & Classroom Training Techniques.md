## Objectives:
The learner develops knowledge of the elements related to course & lesson development as required in the Instructor ACS.

## Elements
[[#Teaching]]
[[#Course of Training]]
[[#Preparation of a Lesson]]
[[#Organization of Material]]
[[#Training Delivery Methods]]
[[#Electronic Learning]]
[[#Instruction Aids and Training Technologies]]
[[#Integrated Flight Instruction]]
[[#Problem Based Instruction]]

## Teaching
Teaching is to instruct or train
### Process
The teaching process organizes the material in such a way that the learner can understand

Consists of four steps:
1. Preparation
2. Presentation
3. Application
4. Assessment
### 4 Essential Teaching Skills
1. [[#People Skills]]
2. [[#Subject Matter Expertise]]
3. [[#Assessment Skills]]
4. [[#Management Skills]]

#### People Skills
Effective instructors relate well to people and can effectively communicate.
* Technical knowledge is useless if the instructor fails to communicate effectively
* The two way process of effective communication includes actively listening to the learner.

People skills also include the ability to:
- Interact respectfully
- Pick up when learners are not following along
- Provide motivation
- Adapt to the needs of the learner when necessary
- Challenge learners intellectually while supporting their efforts

Effective instructors also display enthusiasm for the subject matter and express themselves clearly
#### Subject Matter Expertise
A subject matter expert (SME) possesses a high level of expertise, knowledge, or skill in a particular area.
- Have a sincere interest in learning and professional growth.
- Be a lifelong learner, network, and continue to develop professionally.
#### Assessment Skills
- Used to verify the learners progress.
	- It can occur before, during, and after training.
- The purpose of the assessment needs to be clear.

It is discussed in detail in [[FAA-H-8083-9B - Aviation Instructors Handbook.pdf#page=132|AIH Chapter 6: Assessment]] and in [[I.D. Student Evaluation, Assessment, and Testing]]
#### Management Skills
- The ability to plan, organize, lead, and supervise.
- Effective time management to achieve goals without over planning
- Supervision of learners when necessary
## Course of Training
A complete series of studies leading to a specific goal, and includes a [[#Curriculum]], [[#Syllabus]], and [[#Lesson Plans]]

Having a course of training ensures that all regulatory certification requirements are met.

### Curriculum
The  courses for various certificates and ratings
### Syllabus
Summary/outline of an individual course of study containing multiple lessons
- Has a description of each lesson, including objectives and completion standards

### Lesson plans
Detailed plan for how a specific lesson is conducted

 Includes:
 - Objective
 - Organization of material
 - Teaching aids
 - Instructor/learner actions
 - Evaluation Criteria
 - Completion Standards

>[!tldr] Purpose of the Lesson Plan
>- Assure a wise selection of material and the elimination of unimportant details
>- Make certain due consideration is given to each part of the lesson
>- Aid the instructor in presenting the material in a suitable sequence for efficient learning
>- Provide an outline of the teaching procedure to be used
>- Serve as a means of relating the lesson to the objectives of the training course
>- Give the inexperienced instructor confidence
>- Promote uniformity of instruction regardless of the instructor or when the lesson is given

#### Characteristics of a Well-Planned Lesson
##### Unity
Each lesson should be a unified segment of instruction
##### Content
Each lesson should contain new material, but be related to the lesson previously presented
##### Scope
Each lesson should be reasonable in scope to prevent confusion or inefficiency
##### Practicality
Each lesson should be planned in terms of the conditions under which the training is to be conducted
##### Flexibility
Flexibility should be incorporated as needed

#### How to Use a Lesson Plan Properly
- Be familiar with the lesson plan
- Use the lesson plan as a guide
- Adapt the lesson plan to the class or learner
- Ensure the lesson plan is appropriate to the background, flight experience, and ability of the particular learner
	- Modify as necessary due to deficiencies in the learner's knowledge or poor mastery of the elements essential to effective completion of the lesson
- Revise the lesson plan periodically

## Preparation of a Lesson
A lesson must be planned, to include:
- Training Objectives
- Procedures and facilities
- Goals to be attained
- Review and Evaluation

### Training Objectives
Aviation training involves two types of objectives: [[#Performance Based]] and [[#Decision Based]]. As the learner progresses through higher levels of performance and understanding, training focus should shift from Performance Based to Decision Based training objectives.
#### Performance Based
Define exactly what needs to be done and how it is done

Performance based objectives set measurable, reasonable standards describing the learner's desired performance
	Can be referred to as a behavioral, performance, instructional, or educational objective
		All refer to the same thing, the behavior of the learner

Provide a way of stating the level of performance a learner needs to demonstrate before moving on to the next thing

Consists of three elements
1. Description of the skill or behavior
	- Explains the desired outcome as a change in knowledge, skill, or attitude.
	- Should be concrete and in measurable terms
2. The conditions
	- Explains the rules for demonstration of the skill 
	- Should include:
		- Equipment
		- Tools
		- Reference Material
		- Limiting Parameters
3. The criteria
	- Standards that measure the accomplishment. Should define performance such that there is no question whether the performance meets the objective. 
#### Decision Based
Develops pilot judgement and ADM skills. Facilitate a higher level of learning and application by using dynamic and meaningful scenarios.

Requires dynamic problem solving of the learner.
## Organization of Material
The traditional organization of a lesson plan is [[#Introduction]], [[#Development]], and [[#Conclusion]]

### Introduction
The intro sets the stage for everything to come, and is made up of [[#Attention]], [[#Motivation]], and an [[#Overview]]

#### Attention
To focus each learner's attention on the lesson.
	Can be a story, a video clip, a question, a joke, anything that relates to the subject and establishes a background for developing the learning outcomes
#### Motivation
Offers the learners specific reasons why the lesson content is important to know, understand, apply or perform and ensures readiness 
#### Overview
Tells the learner(s) what is to be covered during the period. Should be a clear, concise presentation of the objective and key ideas to give a road map.
### Development
The main part of the lesson, where the instructor develops the subject matter so that the learner achieves the desired outcome

The material is organized logically to show the relationships between the main points, and can be organized in one of the following ways:
* Past to Present
	Arranged chronologically from the present to the past, or from the past to the present
- Simple to Complex
	Lead the learner from simple facts or ideas to an understanding of the phenomena or concepts involved.
		Less important information can be omitted initially to simplify the learning process
- Known to Unknown
	Starting with something the learner already knows, the instructor can then lead into new ideas and concepts.
- Most Frequently Used to Least Used
	Start with commonly used items that apply to everyone before progressing to rarer ones that may only apply to some.

Under each main point in a lesson, the subordinate points should lead from one to another naturally.
### Conclusion
Retrace the important elements of the lesson and relate them to the objective. This reinforces learning and improves retention.
	Do not introduce new ideas into the conclusion
## Training Delivery Methods
There are a variety of methods to present instructional material, typically used in combination of more than one.

These include:
- [[#Lecture Method]]
- [[#Discussion Method]]
- [[#Guided Discussion Method]]
- [[#Problem Based]]
- [[#Group Learning]]
- [[#Demonstration-Performance]]
- [[#Drill and Practice]]
- [[#Electronic Learning]]

### Lecture Method
The instructor delivers knowledge via lectures to learners who are more or less silent participant.
	Best used when an instructor wishes to convey a general understanding of a subject

Typically setup of a lecture is:
1. Introduction of the topic to be discussed
2. Body of the lecture
3. Summary of main points

There are different types of lectures as well:
#### Illustrated talk
Visual aids heavily relied on
#### Briefing
A concise array of facts are presented to listeners who do not expect elaboration of supporting material
#### Formal Lecture
Presentation with little to no verbal participation by the learners
#### Teaching Lecture
Instructor plans and delivers an oral presentation that allows for participation by the learners and helps direct them toward desired learning outcome.
- Favored by aviation instructors â†’ Allows for some active participation
	- Feedback on reaction from learner can be difficult to interpret
##### Preparing the Teaching Lecture
1. Establish the objective and desired outcome
2. Research the subject
3. Organize the material
4. Plan productive classroom activities

- Use simple words whenever possible
- Don't use substandard English or errors in grammar
- Clearly define technical terms to ensure understanding
- Use specific words instead of general terms

##### Delivery
- Speak from a mental or written outline
	Do not read or memorize the material to be presented. The exact words to express an idea are spontaneous
- Elaborate topics further if learners fail to grasp the concept
- Use notes to ensure accuracy, jog the memory, and prevent forgetting
	Use notes sparingly and unobtrusively, but don't hide them
- Encourage active learner participation

##### Advantages and Disadvantages
Lectures are convenient for instructing large groups, and can present many ideas in a short amount of time, but are not perfect for attainment of certain types of learning outcomes (i.e. motor skills) and can result in less engaged learners.

### Discussion Method
Modification of the pure lecture form by using lecture and then discussion to integrate learner into process

Instructor provides a short lecture to give basic knowledge, and then is followed by instructor/learner and learner/learner discussion.
	It is important to keep the discussion focused on the subject matter and to ensure everyone has the opportunity to comment, listen, think, and participate

This method also allows the learner to develop [[Higher Order Thinking Skills]]. The instructor should keep their own discussion to a minimum to allow for maximum learner participation.

### Guided Discussion Method
Instructor-guided discussion is used with the instructor maintaining control of the discussion, and the learner must have a level of knowledge about the topic to be discussed.
	Can be used during classroom periods and preflight/postflight briefings

The goal is to draw out the knowledge of the learner, with the instructor as a facilitator using effective questions.

#### Characteristics of an Effective Question
 - Applies to the subject of instruction
 - Is brief and concise, but also clear and definite
 - Is adapted to the learner's ability, experience, and stage of training
 - Centers on only one idea
 - Presents a challenge to the learners

#### Planning a Guided Discussion
- Select an appropriate topic
	Learners must have some level of knowledge to exchange
- State the specific lesson objective
- Conduct adequate research to become familiar with the topic
- Organize the points in a logical sequence
	There are 3 main parts to the guided discussion
		1. Introduction
			- Attention
			- Motivation
			- Overview
		1. Discussion
		2. Conclusion
- Have at least one lead off question for each desired learning outcome to stimulate discussion

### Problem Based
Consists of a carefully constructed problem to which there is no single solution
	This helps the learner gain a deeper understanding of the information and improve the ability to recall it

PBL helps the learner make meaning of the information based on past experience and personal interpretation, which encourages development of [[Higher Order Thinking Skills]].

Effective problems for PBL:
1. Relate to the real world so learners want to solve them
2. Require learners to make decisions
3. Are open-ended and not limited to one correct answer
4. Are connected to previously learned knowledge as well as new knowledge
5. Reflect lesson objective(s)
6. Challenge learners to think critically

### Group Learning
Learners are organized into small groups who can work together to maximize understanding.
	Learners completing cooperative learning group tasks tend to have better test scores, higher self-esteem, improved social skills, and greater comprehension.

Group learning continually requires active participation in the learning process

Group learning depends on conditions and controls to ensure success, and the instructor must do thorough planning to determine what the group is expected to learn and to be able to do on their own.  Useful conditions and controls include:
- Small, heterogeneous groups
- Clear, complete instructions of what the learners are to do, in what order, with what materials, and when appropriate
- Learner perception of targeted objectives as their own personal objectives
- The opportunity for learner success
- Learner access to and comprehension of required information
- Sufficient time for learning
- Individual accountability
- Recognition and rewards for group success
- Time after completion of group tasks for learners to reflect on how they worked together as a team

### Demonstration-Performance
Best used for the mastery of mental or physical skills that require practice.
	Based on the principle of learning by doing

Demonstration-Performance method is divided into 5 phases:
1. Explanation
	Instructor conveys the precise actions that the learner is to perform, and the end result of the efforts
		Explanation must be clear and pertinent to the objectives, and based on the known experience and knowledge of the learner
2. Demonstration
	Instructor shows the learners the actions necessary to perform a skill
3. Learner Performance/4. Instructor Supervision
	These occur simultaneously, with the learner performing the skill while the instructor supervises the attempt.
5. Evaluation
	Instructor judges learner performance
		The learner displays whatever competence has been attained and the instructor identifies how well the skill has been mastered
### Drill and Practice
Based on Thorndike's law of exercise, predicts that connections are strengthened with practice
	The mind rarely retains/evaluates/applies new concepts after one exposure, they learn by practicing and applying what they have been told and shown.
		Learning happens every time practice occurs

### Electronic Learning
An umbrella term for any type of education that involves an electronic component, and comes in many formats, from standalone software to an interactive web-based course. 

The active nature of e-learning enhances the overall learning process, and allows the learner to feel more in control of the content and how fast they learn it. It is also typically more enjoyable than learning from a classroom lecture.

E-learning does potentially have some limitations, which can include a lack of peer interaction and personal feedback. It can also be difficult to find good programs for certain subject areas, and they can have high costs.

Improper or excessive use of e-learning should be avoided, but can be a powerful addition to the teaching tools arsenal.
## Instruction Aids and Training Technologies
Devices that assist an instructor in the teaching/learning process
- Aids are not self-supporting, they help reinforce what its being taught
- Aids can help solve language barrier problems
- Aids help clarify the relationship between material objects and concepts
- Aids help learners gain knowledge faster and more accurately

Certain factors are generally agreed on to understand the use of instructional aids:
- Carefully selected visual aids are examples of items that help the learner understand and retain essential information
- Instructional aids ideally cover the key points and concepts
- Coverage should be straightforward and factual
- The best aids are relatively simple

Instructional aids help gain and hold the attention of learners
	NOTE: Should keep the attention on the subject, not be a distracting gimmick


>[!tldr] Guidelines for Use of Instructional Aids:
>- Support the lesson objective
>- Are learner centered
>- Build on previous learning
>- Contain useful and meaningful content that is consistent with sound principles of learning
>- Appeal to learners
>- Maintain learner attention and interest
>- Encourage learner participation when appropriate
>- Lead learners in the direction of the behavior or outcomes specified in the learning objective
>- Provide proper stimuli and reinforcement
>- Contain quality photo, graphs, and/or text as required
>- Are checked prior to use for completeness and technical accuracy
>- Contain appropriate terminology for the learner
>- Are properly sequenced
>- Are easy to understand
>- Include appropriate safety precautions

>[!tldr] Common Types of Instructional Aids
>- White Board/Markers
>- Supplemental Print Materials (Photos, drawings, charts, diagrams, graphs, etc.)
>- Enhanced Training Materials 9syllabi, maneuvers guide, handbook, etc)
>- Projected Material
>- Video
>- Interactive System (Software, etc)
>- Computer-Assisted Learning
>- Models, Mockups, and Cut-Aways
## Integrated Flight Instruction
Flight instruction during which learners are taught to perform flight maneuvers both by outside visual references and by reference to flight instruments

### Development of Habit Patterns
The learner must establish the habit of observing and relying on flight instruments from the beginning of flight training, but they must also learn the feel and sounds of the airplane while conducting maneuvers
	Learners will develop the habit of continuously monitoring their own and the aircraft's performance

### Operating Efficiency
As learners become more proficient in monitoring and correcting their own flight technique by reference to the instruments, their performance increases noticeably.

### Procedures
Each new maneuver is introduced using both outside and instrument references with the learner developing the ability to maneuver an aircraft equally as well by instrument or outside reference

### See and Avoid
From the start of training ensure learners develop the habit of looking for other air traffic at all times
	Ensure that the learner does not solely believe that the instructor assumes all responsibility for scanning and collision avoidance procedures

Ensure that [91.113](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFRe4c59b5f5506932/section-91.113) "right of way" rules are introduced
## Problem Based Instruction
Involves an incentive or need to solve the problem.  It includes:
- A decision on how to find a solution
- A possible solution
- An explanation for the reasons used to reach that solution
- Reflection on the solution

There are three types of PBI:
1. [[#Scenario Based]]
2. [[#Collaborative Problem Solving]]
3. [[#Case Study]]

### Scenario Based
Uses highly structed scripts of real world experiences to address training in an operation environment
	Presents realistic situations to allow learners to rehearse mentally and explore practical applications of knowledge

Scenarios require the pilot to manage resources, exercise sound judgement, and make timely decisions

Scenarios do not have to have a single right or wrong answer

A good scenario:
- Is not a test
- Will not have a single right answer
- Does not offer an obvious answer
- Should not promote errors
- Should promote [[Situational Awareness]] and opportunities for decision making

### Collaborative Problem Solving
The instructor provides a problem to the group to solve collaboratively, and the instructor provides limited assistance.
	Open ended "what if" problems encourage learners to develop [[Higher Order Thinking Skills]]

### Case Study
Contains a story relative to the learner that forces them to deal with situations encountered in real life
	Learners analyze situation, come to conclusions, and offer possible solutions.

>[!info] Case Studies
>NTSB accident investigations provide an excellent source of real-world case studies for instructors. By removing probable cause determinations, instructor can use the description as a case study and allow the learner(s) to discuss probable cause, analyze the case, and suggest possible reasons for the accident.

## Planning Instructional Activity
Planning is required for four key areas:
- [[#Course of Training]]
- [[#Blocks of Learning]]
- [[#Training Syllabus]]
- [[#Lesson plans]]

### Blocks of Learning
The blocks of learning constitute the necessary parts of the total objective
	The blocks should represent units of learning which can be measured and evaluated, not a sequence of periods of instructions
	
	![[Blocks of Learning.png]]
	Example of Presolo Stage Blocks

### Training Syllabus
A practical guide to help the instructor ensure training is accomplished in a logical sequence and that all requirements are completed and properly documented

>[!tldr] Syllabus Format and Content
>- Should be in the form of an abstract or digest of the course of training
>- Should contain blocks of learning to be accomplished in the most efficient order
>- Should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to cover the essential information, typically in outline format with lesson-by-lesson coverage
>- Should stress well-defined objectives and standards for each lesson

>[!Info] How to Use a Training Syllabus
>- The training syllabus needs to be flexible and should be used primarily as a guide.
>- Under Part 61, the order of training can and should be altered to suit the progress of the learner
>- The syllabus should be flexible enough to adapt to anything that crops up unexpectedly (weather, aircraft availability, schedule changes, etc).
