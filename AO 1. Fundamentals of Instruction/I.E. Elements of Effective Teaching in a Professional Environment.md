# Completion Standards
The learner understands the responsibilities associated with instructing as well as the characteristics related to being a professional.
## Aviation Instructor Responsibilities
The job of an aviation instructor is to transfer aviation knowledge.
- Instructors help learners meet and exceed established standards.
- Instructors measure learner performance against those standards and give positive reinforcement along the way.

### Helping Learners
##### Learning should be enjoyable
- This helps the learner maintain a high level of motivation
	- The instructor should not sacrifice standards of performance to make things easy
- The key to helping learners is the use of standards and measurement against standards.
##### Learning should be interesting
- Knowing the objective gives meaning and interest to the learner
	- Not knowing objectives often leads to confusion, disinterest, and uneasiness

### Providing Adequate Instruction
The flight instructor analyzes the learner's personality, thinking, and ability, and can therefore tailor their teaching technique to the learner.
- An instructor who incorrectly analyzes the learner may find the instructor does not produce the desired results.

For learners that exhibit slow progress, instructors should assign more easily attained goals

For learners that exhibit fast progress, constantly raise the standard of performance for each lesson, demanding greater effort.

### Standards of Performance
The instructor is responsible for training an applicant to established standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in the tasks within each area of operation in the appropriate ACS/PTC.
- The ACS/PTS is a testing document, not a teaching document

### Emphasizing the Positive
An aviation instructor's ability to teach in a manner that gives learners a positive image of aviation contributes to the instructor's success.
- Negative self-concept inhibits the perceptual process
- Fear adversely affects learner perceptions
- The feeling of being threatened limits the ability to perceive
- Negative motivation is not as effective as positive motivation

Emphasize the positive because positive instruction results in positive learning.

### Minimizing Learner Frustration
Minimizing learner frustration is an important instructor responsibility.  Instructors can encourage (rather than discourage) learners by following some basic rules:
##### Motivate learners
- More can be gained from wanting to learn than from being forced to learn
##### Keep learners informed
- Learners feel insecure when they do not know what is expected of them or what is going to happen to them
##### Approach learners as individuals
- Make sure to consider the individual and their needs, not just the group
##### Give credit when due
- Give praise as a reward to provide incentive to do better for the learner.
##### Criticize constructively
- Identify mistakes and errors, and provide explanations of how to improve in the future.
##### Be consistent
- Ensure there is a consistent philosophy and action from the instructor
##### Admit Errors
- Admit your own mistakes to allow give credibility and to be honest with the student.

## Flight Instructor Responsibilities
Instructor responsibilities are very serious, as their students will eventually be flying, servicing, or repairing aircraft. They also determine when pilots are ready to solo, which is one of the most important responsibilities.

Instructors should be current and proficient in the aircraft they use, and encourage each pilot to learn as much as possible and to continually raise the bar.

Instructors teach other pilots to remain focused on safety and to use risk mitigation. It is their responsibility to train competent, safe, and smart pilots who will be an asset to the aviation community

### Physiological Obstacles for Flight Learners
Instructors cannot ignore the existence of negative factors for learners, and should not ridicule learners that are adversely affected
- A sick or uncomfortable learner is preoccupied and may not have the mental or physical capacity to learn
### Ensuring Learner Skill Set
Instructors ensure learner pilots develop the required skills and knowledge prior to solo.  
- Learner pilots need to show consistency in the required solo tasks

Prior to the checkride, the instructor must provide instruction for each item in the applicable ACS, including "special emphasis areas"

Mastery of the skill set includes consistent use as well as increased accuracy of performance.
## Qualifications and Professionalism
### Flight Instructor Qualifications
Instructor needs to be thoroughly familiar with the functions, characteristics, and proper use of all flight instruments, avionics, and other aircraft systems used for training.

Instructor should maintain familiarity with current pilot training techniques and certification requirements.

### Flight Instructor Characteristics
#### Professionalism
The instructor is the central figure in aviation training and bears responsibility for all phases of training.
#### Sincerety
Be straightforward and honest at all times. Do not attempt to hide inadequacy, it can lead to loss of confidence and adversely affect learning
#### Acceptance of the Learner
Accept the learner as they are, including faults and problems.  Acceptance (rather than ridicule) and support (rather than reproof) will encourage learning
#### Personal Appearance and Habits
The learner will expect the instructor to be neat, clean, and appropriately dressed. Personal habits and cleanliness have a significant effect.
#### Demeanor
Attitude and behavior contribute to a professional image. Development of a calm, thoughtful, and disciplined demeanor is important, without being somber.  Portray competence in the subject matter and genuine interest in the learner's well being.
#### Proper Language
Speak normally, without inhibitions. Speak positively and descriptively, without profanity.

## Professional Development
Aviation changes rapidly, and the instructor needs to continue to develop their knowledge and skills in order to teach successfully.
- Be alert for ways to improve qualifications, effectiveness, and services provided to the learner.
- Maintain a steady supply of fresh material to make instruction interesting and up to date.

#### Continuing Education
Continually update knowledge and skills.  There are many sources to assist in doing so, including:
- Government
	- Seminars, articles, regulations, ACs
	- Pilot Proficiency Award Program
	- Gold Seal Flight Certificate
- Educational/Training Institutions
	- Attend classes at community colleges, technical schools, etc.
- Commercial Organizations
	- Training material and courses
- Industry Organizations
	- Articles, publications, training programs
#### Sources of Material
- Maintain access to current flight publications
	- Regulations
	- AIM
	- PTS/ACS
	- ACs
- Maintain/get access to commercial handbooks, periodicals, technical journals, etc.

## Instructor Ethics & Conduct
A formal code of conduct/ethics promotes safety, good judgement, ethical behavior, and personal responsibility.
- [Flight Instructors Model Code of Conduct](https://www.secureav.com/FIMCC-Listings-Page.html)

>[!Important] Remember that the instructor is teaching a pilot who should:
>- Make safety the #1 priority
>- Develop and exercise good judgement in making decisions
>- Recognize and manage risk effectively
>- Be accountable for their actions
>- Act with responsibility and courtesy
>- Adhere to prudent operating practices and personal operating parameters
>- Adhere to applicable laws and regulations
>- Seek proficiency in control of the aircraft
>- Use flight deck technology in a safe and appropriate way
>- Be confident in a wide variety of flight situations
>- Be respectful of the privilege of flight
